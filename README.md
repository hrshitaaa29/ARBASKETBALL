# AR Basketball Game

## Introduction

AR Basketball Game is a project that brings a simple augmented reality basketball experience to Android devices. The game allows users to place a basketball hoop and a basketball in their environment using AR and interact with them. Currently, the game includes basic mechanics like plane detection and tap-to-place objects. The 3D models for the basketball hoop and the basketball were created using Blender.

## Features

- **Tap-to-Place Mechanics:** Users can place the basketball hoop and ball on a detected plane in their environment.
- **Plane Detection:** Utilizes AR to detect flat surfaces where objects can be placed.

## Prerequisites

- An Android device with ARCore support.

## Steps

### Build and Run on Android

1. **Connect your Android device to your computer.**
2. **In Unity, go to `File > Build Settings`.**
3. **Select Android and click `Build and Run`.**

## Usage

### Launch the Application

- Open the app on your Android device.

### Detect a Plane

- Move your device around to detect flat surfaces.

### Tap to Place

- Tap on the screen to place the basketball hoop and ball on the detected plane.

## 3D Models

The 3D models for the basketball hoop and basketball were created in Blender.

## Project Status

This project is currently incomplete with the following features implemented:

- Plane detection for placing objects.
- Tap-to-place mechanics.

Future development is needed for:

- Adding game physics and interaction with the basketball.
- Developing game logic and scoring.
- Enhancing the user interface and experience.

## Challenges

This project was developed for Android, but testing was limited due to availability of an iOS device. Functionality may need further testing on an Android device.

## Acknowledgements

- 3D modeling done using Blender by the project creator.
- Inspiration from AR games.
